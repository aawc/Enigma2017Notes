###### Writing Rules
- User defined function that evaluates to false/true
- Rule looks like this:
```python
@rule('invalid_user, ...)
   def invalid_user (rec):
     return true
```

### Neural and Behavioral Insights on Trust

###### Overview
- More activity in Amygdala related to more distrust.
- Don't make people think of things they don't do in offline situations
  - Example: Store credit card at checkout.
- Don't make people think about uncertainity (50/50 risk).
- People hate ambiguity (no/little information about risk and reward) even more than uncertainity.
- Activity in Amygdala doesn't clearly mean that people distrust online activity, but it may be related.

###### Toy task
- 100 chips in bag. Red or Blue. No other color.
- If I draw Red, you win!
- But I may not tell you how many Red chips there are.
- Result: Finding out more data makes you more confident. (Makes sense.)

###### Summary
- Don't focus on trust -- focus on uncertainity.
- Favorable and unfavorable information has value for uninformed.
- How people feel is critical in determining how people act.
